#  String Theory Notes

The universe is made of atoms.
These atoms are made of protons, neutrons and electrons.

The electron is a fundamental particle.

String theory looks to solve two major problems in physics, a microscopic theory of gravity and a unified description of fundamental particles.

Essentially, it suggests that all fundamental particles are different manifestations of a more basic object: a string.

A string can oscillate in different ways, and these different forms have the different properties of our fundamental particles.



An extension of the standard model can be derived from a theory of strings, however there have been no observations that suggest String Theory is a true description of nature.
