#  String Theory Notes

The universe is made of atoms.
These atoms are made of protons, neutrons and electrons.

The electron is a fundamental particle.

String theory looks to solve two major problems in physics, a microscopic theory of gravity and a unified description of fundamental particles.

Essentially, it suggests that all fundamental particles are different manifestations of a more basic object: a string.

A string can oscillate in different ways, and these different forms have the different properties of our fundamental particles.

If we were to observe an electron, according to string theory we would see a string, oscillating in a way that has the properties of an electron.

However, if this string was to oscillate in a different way, it would no longer hold the properties of an electron, instead a quark or a photon, etc.

Although String Theory fits into the standard model, there is no direct experimental evidence that suggests String Theory is a correct description of Nature.
