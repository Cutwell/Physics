#  Field Theory Notes
#  The standard model of particle physics

Space is composed of fields, disturbances in these fields create particles.
 - Electromagnetic field; for photons.
 - Electron field; for electrons and positrons.

 - Matter field; for quarks and leptons.
 - Force field; for bosons.

The fields can together generate 17 particles.
 - Leptons
 - Quarks
 - Bosons

Quarks and leptons are made by matter fields while bosons are made by force fields.

A 'rule' of the universe is called a force, and there are four known forces.
1. Electromagnetism - governs atomic bonds and flow of energy
2. Gravity - attracts particles
3. Strong nuclear force - force inside atoms
4. Weak nuclear force - force between atoms


Bosons carrys information 'connecting' matter particles and giving them mass and charge.


Quarks exchange strong nuclear force bosons, communicating the strong nuclear attraction to each other.
Electrons exchange with the protons formed from these quarks using particles of electromagnetism, photons.
Therefore quarks become 'trapped' and form protons, while electrons orbit due to the force of attraction, bulding atoms (in this case a hydrogen atom).
